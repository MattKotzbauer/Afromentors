Connecting members of the Afropolitan community with relevant teachers, mentors, and seminars, Afromentors gives Afropolitan NFT holders tight-knit learning and networking opportunities while letting teachers earn compensation for their expertise.

Teachers work with Afropolitan to create events for NFT holders, which are then displayed on the Afromentors webpage. Upon connecting their Web3 wallet to Afromentors, a holder of the correct NFT can verify their ownership to gain access to the event portal, which reveals a secure link to the event.

Though this, a community is created between holders of the Afropolitan NFT, where holders attend events together and network both with the professionals and one another. This sense of community creates a new sense of demand in renting and buying the Afropolitan NFT, appreciating the NFT and franchise.
